# Meetup #13: Trinity College Dublin, GMB Debating Chamber

We were delighted to have talks from: Ernesto Diaz-Aviles, Debasis Ganguly, Ahmed Abdelkader.

## Ernesto Diaz-Aviles | Chief Data Scientist and VP, Citi Innovation Lab

Deep Learning for Recommender Systems

> Deep Learning is one of the next big things in Recommender Systems. During the past few years deep neural networks have shown tremendous success in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). Deep learning methods are also becoming a powerful tool to tackle Recommender Systems tasks such as music, news, fashion articles, and mobile apps recommendation. In this talk, I will present an exploration of current research in this particular field. The aim is to help identify new opportunities for research and industrial application of Deep Learning to enhance the recommendation experience
